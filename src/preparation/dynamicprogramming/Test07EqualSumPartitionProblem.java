same as Test06SubsetSumProblem. If the sum of elements of array is odd, then no equal partition
is possible. However if sum is even,
we can find half and then just check if this half sum is equal to any subset in the array or not,
 i.e. Test06problem. As other half will
be same number, so we git whether equal sum partition is possible or not.
